# Iron Man List App: Nerding out on Iron Man Suits

After signing up and signing in, this application allows the user to create an entry describing an Iron Man Suit. Just a place where one can add their favorite suit or make one up entirely and add a description of it. Once added if wanted the user can update it or remove the entry.
